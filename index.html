	<p class="about">My name is Liam Mansfield and this website contains information to potential employers and friends. 
		At the time of writing, I am an Electrical Engineering student who is looking to specialize in renewable energies or mass transit - specifically trains or hydro. 
		My hobbies include computer building, programming, rugby, squash, bananagrams and board games. 
		I have proficiencies in Rust, Java and C++, I am also teaching myself HTML and CSS, hence this website. 
		As of writing, my homelab includes a LAMP Stack for DNS management and calendar syncing, a media server for movies and shows, an SFTP, vnc and ssh server to perform maintenance on said server and transfer files.
		The Lab also in includes 3 Debian Machines, one of which is my NAS, and a Manjaro machine - I spend a lot of time in the terminal.
		I've built my personal computer myself and I've upgraded the other 3 devices that I own to store more information and run faster.
		When I'm not studying or working with electronics, I'm usually doing something rugby related.
		At the moment, I am a certified WR level 1 referee, a level 2 formed coach and a starter for the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue Rugby Football Club Men's 1st XV.
		Enjoy your time on my site!
